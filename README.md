# Bib2csv - Script 
--------------------

For my Bachelorthesis I needed a small Programm to convert my bib file to a handy `.csv`-File. This small script resulted in this. 

Make sure to run:
```python 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or 
```python 
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This should work for most bibtex types. Feel free to modify and add you own stuff! :)
